# irrigation-system-simulation
This project is about a smart irrigation system made using Python. It checks temperature, humidity, and soil moisture to decide if the pump should be ON or OFF.  If the soil is dry, the temperature is high, and humidity is low, the pump turns ON. If not, it stays OFF to save water.  The system shows the data in a table and graph. .
